	 * Lab 1: Duck-App

	 * @author Hannah Mittman
	 * 
	 * The client wants us to create a Duck App (application name: DuckApp) 
	 * that simulates the following two types of ducks:
	 * - Mallard Duck (classname: MallardDuck)
	 * - Redhead Duck (classname: RedheadDuck)
	 * A duck should be able to exhibit the following behaviors:
	 * - Quack (method name: quack())
	 * - Swim (method name: swim())
	 * - Display itself on the screen
	 * 
	 * The way Redhead Duck is displayed is different than the way the 
	 * Mallard Duck is displayed. The client has wants to get a working 
	 * prototype first. They are not interested in any fancy UI to begin 
	 * with. For now, you can check what type of duck it is by simply passing 
	 * it passing it (a duck object) to some print function (For example: 
	 * System.out.println()).  It should print the following message “I am 
	 * a MallardDuck. My name is Mr. Mallard Sr.”.  The type of duck is the 
	 * classname and the name should be some unique string. to standard output, 
	 * and the Redhead Duck is displayed by printing “I am a RedheadDuck. My name 
	 * is Mr. Readhead Jr.”. The duck should be able to swim when you call the swim() 
	 * method on them and Quack when you call the quack() method. To show that the right 
	 * method is called, they should print, ”I am <Name> of the <ClassName> class of 
	 * ducks and I am swimming”, and “Quack! Quack! says <Name> of the <ClassName> class 
	 * of ducks”.
